# Shut Hitman

Safely closes the process of HITMAN 3 (HITMAN World of Assassination), mainly used for Freelancer mode.

Alternative to ALT+F4 since it [now leads to failing a mission](https://ioi.dk/hidden/h3-patchnotes?panel=hitman%2Fpatch-notes%2F2023%2Fhitman-woa-may-patch-notes#:~:text=Alternate%20Function%20Four).

# Usage
1. Open `shut_hitman.exe`
2. Press `F5` to close and restart the application

# Notes
You can add `-skip_launcher` to your launch params in the Steam for skipping the launcher window
